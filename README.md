# SIMS Project 9 Submission
 ## STOCK INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ( SIMS )                            
 The SIMS (Stock Inventory Mangment System ) Prototype shows the step by step Logical order and sequence in which the application is meant to function and interact when the whole application is finished .
The prototype is just a concept of ideas that i want to incoporate but the overall layout and design might change as the project goes along but the concept of the application and use wont change .
